          <p>I did some sewing stuff while I was in middle school, for my schoolwork. Been seeing my grandma doing it like it's nothing special and aunts just talking to 4 other aunts and sewing so neatly. </p>

          <p>I haven't been in my hometown for more or less four years now, and I had loads of time in the last four months. And, I picked up sewing after a long time. And this blog is just a way to flex about it! :D</p>

            <p>There are mostly traditional stitches as well as some I completely made up(like the pink borders of petals). Apart from the technical stuff, it required a lot of <i>patience</i>. I am someone who can't focus on one thing at a time. I almost always throw up a <a href= "https://youtube.com/gothamchess"> Gothamchess</a> video in the background and continue with my sewing.</p>
            <p>This was an experimental work which was fun but it kept becoming hard and hard to finish, each time I said finish. Something else comes to my mind. Help!</p>
            <p> At one time I thought it is enough. Just get over it! Turned out pretty well, I guess.</p>
