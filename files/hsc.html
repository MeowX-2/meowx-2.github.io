      <div class="blog-post-ex">
        <p> This is gonna be a short post, I'll just recap my 11th 12th grade.</p>
        <p>I think the academics are atrocious in the school. And I avoided that. I just survived in the exams and just
          barely could keep me in shape. I hated their unnecessary rules. And, almost all of my school exams held during
          my camps. And got rekt from both :')</p>
        <p>With all of these, I still think they are the nicest part of my life. Because,
        <ol type='1'>
          <li>People were nicer to me</li>
          <li><i>Autocracy</i> not in a bad way btw. </li>
          <li> I made many <s>inside jokes</s> memories.
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          The last part of these were stressfull and not upto my level of patience, yet I was able to make it.
