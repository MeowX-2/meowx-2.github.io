            <p> This is gonna be a short post, I'll just recap my 11th 12th grade.</p>
            <p>I think the academics are atrocious in the school. And I avoided that. I just survived in the exams and just barely could keep me in shape. I hated their unnecessary rules. And, almost all of my school exams held during my camps. And got rekt from both :')</p>
            <p>With all of these, I still think they are the nicest part of my life. Because,
            <ol type = '1'>
              <li>People were nicer to me</li>
              <li><i>Autocracy</i> not in a bad way btw. </li>
              <li> I made many <s>inside jokes</s> memories.
            </ol></p>
            <p> 
              The last part of these were stressfull and not upto my level of patience, yet I was able to make it.
