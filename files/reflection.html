                    I am to write about the most significant period of my life; my Math Olympiad Journey has had a lot of ups and downs. I never thought I would be interviewed in big TV channels or newspapers. But it changed my life for the better. And I'm writing it out of gratitude. <br>
                    <p><b>2017</b></p>
                    I told my parents about the competition the first time I knew about it. They didn't have any information about it before, nor did anyone in my neighborhood. They resisted letting me participate there. The funniest part is they said it was a human trafficking organization. However, they couldn't win against my stubbornness. I got there and got myself registered.<br>
                    
                    <p><b>2018</b></p>
                    At the beginning of the year the Math Olympiad was held, there were many people I was a fan of. Particularly, I was a big fan of Munir Hasan, Kaykobad, and Anisul Haque. I took my mom with me to convince her that it was not a scam.
                    
                    The first thing I noticed in the other students was their elitism; they all come from posh schools and colleges like Viqarunnesa, Notre Dame, Holy Cross, Ideal, and plenty of English medium and cadet schools. I knew it was prestigious, but it seemed like I couldn't gauge it properly. The place felt intimidating at first sight.<br>  
                    
                    Unfortunately, I couldn't pass the regional round. But, the satisfaction of convincing my mom that it wasn't a scam came in handy later. I was able to attend classes in my local club, RGS. I went there every week; I remember Ittihad Vai and Lazim Vai took classes there. I learned math but also felt like being in a community there. I started to feel like I was really fit for this place. <br>
                    
                    I bought some Math Olympiad books for the first time that year. I remember never purchasing books outside the textbooks; I just read the PDFs. But seeing others with the books, I felt like buying some for myself. I saved some money and bought the Art and Craft of Problem Solving, Problem Solving Strategies. At this time, I did Math whenever I could in my free time. I liked to do these silly problems regarding basic number theory and counting. However, I was not too fond of geometry back then. I searched for extra problems on the internet and solved them. <br>
                    
                    I read textbooks for classes 9-12 in December, which I borrowed from my neighborhood. I practiced so much that I would occasionally sleep on the table. I was hopeful that I would cross national in 2019.<br> 
                    
                    <p><b>2019</b></p>
                    This year started pretty fun; I had sports responsibility in my school and did not feel much academic pressure. Thus, I could spend my time in class doing math in my free time. From that year, BDMO started to have 3 phases for selection. The first round was easy. The divisional was tougher than the previous year. I only did 5 problems out of 10. I was really stressed that day. But later, I learned that I was not only passed but was also the Champion of that year's Regional. I was psyched.<br>
                    
                    Then, in the national, I came around there, and the first thing I saw was a team of drummers performing at the gate. It was full of a festive environment. Way fancier than the divisional. We had extra T-shirts and accessories. This is the first time I've seen that. My exams were atrocious, but it seemed easy after I came out of the hall. I learned that I had made some counting mistakes and forgot cases. I had expectations to qualify for this. And I didn't.<br>
                    
                    And then, it was my first time crying for a competition. I never thought any competition was so significant. I merely thought of those as a fun event. But I realized it is becoming just more than that. <br>
                    
                    That year, I did the math for the whole year; it sometimes crossed 20 to 30 hours per week while I had academic stuff to do. Otherwise, it could go 4-5 hours a day. I solved my first IMO shortlist problem that year. That 2010 SL G1. It was plain angle chasing that would take me 10-15 minutes now. But I remember it took me 3 hours to solve it. I couldn't sleep from the excitement. <br>
                    
                    This single problem gave me a significant confidence boost in geometry. I was not too fond of geometry before, but it gave me the hope that I could be decent in geometry. <br>
                    
                    <p><b>2020</b></p>
                    
                    The Pandemic hit in March. I didn't know it would stay for years. That year was one of the unluckiest years for me. I barely could pass the regional and didn't qualify for the camp that year. So, I enrolled in courses and extra classes I found online. I just did math even though I knew I could fail. <br>
                    
                    <p><b>2021</b></p>
                    
                    In February, one of my seniors told me I could participate in the EGMO TST. I knew about it the night before the TST. And I didn't have any preparation. But I decided I would participate. I was anticipating failure this time. I knew some female contestants who could qualify for it effortlessly; I simply didn't imagine seeing myself on the list.<br>
                    
                    The exam was held in two days, and I did my best. I didn't make any silly mistakes or anything. I then forgot about it. But to my surprise, 3-4 days later, I saw in the classroom that I was selected; I still ask myself, how? <br>
                    
                    Then there was EGMO camp, which was 1 month long and one of the most intense camps I ever had; I had to do math every day. 
                    Unfortunately, I underperformed in the exam. I spent all my time on day 1 solving the FE in problem 2. And on the second day, I spent my time on Problem 5. Later, I knew problem 1 was the easiest in the exam. But I didn't even try. I thought I had learned my lesson by getting 030 000. But, no.<br> 
                    
                    I found myself making silly mistakes often; I also made mistakes in the camp test or anything significant. I didn't know why I was underperforming that much; people said it was a lack of practice. But I discovered it was more complicated. There is a bit of psychology there. <br>
                    
                    I practiced a lot during that year due to the Pandemic and had almost none of the academic pressures. I could do as much math as I could. I spent hours learning about pole-polar and projective geometry that year. I spent a lot of time teaching myself geometry. Due to COVID-19, I had to be self-reliant in learning. <br>
                    
                    <p><b>2022</b></p>
                    This year paid off some of the efforts that I took in 2021. I qualified for the national BDMO round and was selected for the EGMO 2022, got an honorable mention with 700 004. I almost solved Problem 6, and all the marks I gained from the contest were geo. I also scored 7 on the APMO, equivalent to being in the top 15 in the country in contest-style maths that year. I was also the top 4 performer in the Iranian Geometry and Combinatorics Olympiad. I was selected for the team selection camp as well, which was unexpected. That's why I didn't worry that much about getting into the team. Later, I learned I was also able to get into the IMO Camp, which means being in the top 10 performers in the country. It felt too good to be true. 
                    I became more serious about the Math Olympiad that year. I just wanted to qualify for the 2023 IMO team, which I later realized was too much to ask for. <br>
                    
                    <p><b>2023</b></p>
                    This year was rough, as I had some high expectations. I did math all of the time that I could find after academics. I was selected for EGMO that year as well. That year, every country was required to participate offline. That's why our participation that year was still being determined. I was the fourth contestant, so there was a chance that I might not be able to participate. But fortunately, we could. In the contest, I got 070 607; this year, I actually solved Problem 6, which is said to be the more challenging problem in these contests. I was selected for the team selection camp as well.
                    And that was the brutal part of my whole Math Olympiad journey as a contestant. I couldn't solve as many problems as I needed to solve. I just felt a chill in my body when I was going back home. I told myself it was over now. It's all over. At that moment, I realized how brutal Team Selection Tests can be. <br>
                    
                    I realized long before that I could give it all my best, but I still could fail. In the end, I don't regret participating in such contests; I made many friends along the way, and I still would hang out with my peers. It gave me a lot of insights that I may not get anywhere else.
